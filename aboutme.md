My name is Marcello Montemagno.

I'm a passionate programmer, a simple and quite man :)

### What's in the blog, and why another blog?

As a programmer, I've grown up with a pc replacing my memory, that should be the reason why, I forget things, my memory is very selective and I often end up in writing notes about things I considered useful, interesting, or simply beautiful.

So why the blog? I simply thought that instead of writing notes a blog should have been definitely more ordered and useful.

I like to be very short while taking notes, so I'd like to do the same for my posts, focusing on what really matter about the current topic, avoiding boilerplate conversation, we can hang out for a beer if you'd like to talk :D
