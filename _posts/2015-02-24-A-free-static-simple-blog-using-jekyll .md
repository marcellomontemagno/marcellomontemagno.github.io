### What is jekyll?

Jekyll is a static site generator. It takes raw text files (e.g: Markdown a plain text formatting syntax), and spits out a complete, ready-to-publish static website. You can then serve the generated site using your favorite web server, or, because of Jekyll is also the engine behind GitHub Pages, you can host your website from GitHubâ€™s servers, for free, through a simple commit.

### Features?

- Free, MIT license
- Is static
- Blog-aware
- Customizable

### Looks cool, how to create and run my blog or static site?

- [Install Ruby](http://example.com/ "Install Ruby") (remember to check 'add ruby executables to you path' during the installation)
- run these commands from the directory where you want to create your site
	* gem install jekyll
	- jekyll new your-site-name
	- cd your-site-name
	- jekyll serve
- open your browser at http://localhost:4000

### How to write my first post?

- navigate into the _posts folder
- create a new file with the following naming convention YEAR-MONTH-DAY-title.md
- write your post using Markdown plain text formatting syntax
- refresh your browser at http://localhost:4000, changes should be displayed

### Is learning Markdown worth it? I only care about contents!

That's all you need to know trough an example:

	### An Header

	A simple paragraph

	Another simple paragraph

	> A blockquote.
	> 
	> Another paragraph in the blockquote.

	- list element 1
	- list element 2

	*emphasized text*

	**strong emphasis text**

	a link [example link](http://example.com/ "With a Title"){:target="_blank"}
	
	notice that in the previous link "With a Title" and {:target="_blank"} are optionals

	an image ![alt text](/path/to/img.jpg "Title")

	a litle code block `<blink>`

	a comment block (notice the indentation tabs)

		<div>
			<p>some code</p>
		</div>

### What if I want to customize the style or the pages?

I've choosen the [beautiful-jekyll](http://deanattali.com/beautiful-jekyll/ "beautiful-jekyll"){:target="_blank"} theme 

You can search for an existing theme online (e.g [jekyllthemes.io](http://jekyllthemes.io/ "Jekyll Themes"){:target="_blank"}) or create your own theme. 

Anything you need is in the [Jekyll official documentation](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/home/ "Jekyll doc"){:target="_blank"}
