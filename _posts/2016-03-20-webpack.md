### What is webpack?

Webpack combines both a build system and a module bundler, furthermore it provides code splitting.

With webpack all your assets are considered modules themselves, in other words using webpack in your code you have something like this:

    import stylesheet from 'styles/my-styles.scss';
    import logo from 'img/my-logo.svg';
    import someTemplate from 'html/some-template.html';

    console.log(stylesheet); // "body{font-size:12px}"
    console.log(logo); // "data:image/svg+xml;base64,PD94bWwgdmVyc2lvbj0iMS4wIiBlbmNvZGluZz0iVVRGLTgiIHN0YW5kYWxvbmU9Im5[...]"
    console.log(someTemplate) // "<html><body><h1>Hello</h1></body></html>"

As you see all assets are managed as string/javascript. This allows webpack to wrap them into self contained Javascript modules when you'll need to bundle them.
You could for example create a self contained widget containing html,css,images,js and import it as as single js module when needed.

Webpack use something called "loaders" to know how to transform assets with a particular file extension in string/javascript, loaders can be configured like this:

    module: {
        loaders: [
            {
              test: /\.ts/, // When you import a .ts file, parse it with Typescript
              loader: 'typescript'
            },
            {
              test: /\.scss/, // When you encounter SCSS files
              loaders: ['css', 'autoprefixer', 'sass'] // Parse with node-sass, then autoprefix then return as a css
            }
        ]
    }

Furthermore Webpack provides features to split your codebase into “chunks” (containing both js and other assets like css and images) and these chunks can be loaded on demand only in circumstances when they are needed. This feature is called “code splitting”.

You could for example decide that instead of download your full web application on the first access, your users will download the chunk related to each page only when these pages are opened.

This is particularly useful to reduce single page applications loading time.

### An Hello word example

This example assumes you already have node installed, I've used node v5.0.0 and npm 3.4.0

    npm init
    npm install jquery --save
    npm install webpack --save-dev

Open your package.json and add "build" : "webpack --display-modules --display-chunks" under the scripts property

    "scripts": {
        "build": "webpack --display-modules --display-chunks"
    }

this will allow you to run webpack using 'npm run build' instead of running it like this ./node_modules/webpack/bin/webpack.js or adding it to your path (notice that npm looks for binaries inside node_modules/.bin by default)

create a webpack.config.js

    module.exports = {
        entry: './src', //where sources are located
        output: {
            path: 'builds', //destination path
            filename: 'bundle.js', //destination file name
            publicPath: 'builds/' //tells webpack where to find built assets from the point of view of the page
        },
    };

create a index.js file in the src folder:

    var $ = require('jquery');

    $('body').html('Hello World');

create a index.html file in your project root

    <!DOCTYPE html>
    <html>
    <body>
        <script src="builds/bundle.js"></script>
    </body>
    </html>

run webpack

    npm run build

open your index.html with a browser, you should be able to read 'Hello World'

### Add a first webpack loader

To install a loader in Webpack we need to add the node dependency and then the related configuration to the module.loaders part of your Webpack configuration.

Here we want [babel-loader](https://github.com/babel/babel-loader "babel-loader"){:target="_blank"}, so:

    npm install babel-loader babel-core babel-preset-es2015 --save-dev

add babel to the webpack.config.js

    module: {
        loaders: [
            {
                test: /\.js/, //apply to all files with js extension
                exclude: /(node_modules|bower_components)/, //avoid that babel will treaverse files third-party code
                loader: 'babel', //loader name
                query: {presets: ['es2015']} //loader parameters
            }
        ],
    }

with the babel loader now we can write our javascript using the new ES1015 syntax. Let's change our index.js file to use the ES2015 syntax:

    import $ from 'jquery';

    $('body').html('ES 2015 Hello World');

run webpack

    npm run build

open your index.html with a browser, you should be able to read 'ES 2015 Hello World'

### Some other useful loaders

There's plenty of useful loader here some example:

to tell webpack how to import html files

    npm install html-loader --save-dev

and in your webpack.config.js

    ...
    {
        test:   /\.html/,
        loader: 'html',
    }
    ...

to use sass, to extend the css language

    npm install css-loader style-loader html-loader sass-loader node-sass --save-dev

and in your webpack.config.js

    ...
    {
        test: /\.scss$/,
        loaders: ["style", "css", "sass"]
    }
    ...

to tell webpack how to handle images (if images to be loaded ar smaller than 10kb they will be serialized as strings, if they are bigger an url to the resource will be returned)

    npm install url-loader file-loader --save-dev

and in your webpack.config.js

    ...
    {
        test:   /\.(png|gif|jpe?g|svg)$/i,
        loader: 'url',
        query: {limit: 10000} //if the asset is smaller than 10kb inline it, instead of giving the url
    }
    ...

### Build a self contained example widget

We'll create a simple example widget displaying a grumpy cat image.

create a src/grumpyCatWidget folder and insert the following contents:

a file template.html

    <div class="grumpyCatWidget"></div>

a file style.scss

    .grumpyCatWidget {
      background-image: url('./grumpyCat.jpg');
      background-size: cover;
      width: 100px;
      height: 100px;
    }

the grumpyCat.jpg image

![Grumpy Cat](/img/grumpyCat.jpg "Grumpy Cat")

a file GrumpyCatWidget.js

    import $ from 'jquery';
    import './style.scss';
    import template from './template.html';

    export default class GrumpyCatWidget {

        constructor() {}

        render(node) {
            $(node).append(template);
        }

    }

override your index.js with the following contents:

    import $ from 'jquery';
    import GrumpyCatWidget from './GrumpyCatWidget/GrumpyCatWidget.js';

    new GrumpyCatWidget().render($('body'));

run webpack

    npm run build

open your index.html you should be able to see a grumpy cat displayed

As you noticed we imported the GrumpyCatWidget.js and all the assets belonging to it with a single import statement. That is possible because webpack consider any asset as a string/javascript and he know how to do it through the configured loaders.

### Code splitting

If you look inside the builds folder you will still see a single bundje.js file, so even if we build 10 self contained chunks of our application you will always end up importing a single monolithic js with all our code when the application is displayed the first time.
So how ho split our new widget into a separate js? To tell webpack to split the grumpy cat widget into a separate js that can be imported on demand you can use any async module definition that you already know, webpack will consider it as a split point.

Using the commonJs syntax we can override our index.js with

    import $ from 'jquery';

    require.ensure([], () => {
        var GrumpyCatWidget = require('./grumpyCatWidget/GrumpyCatWidget.js').default;
        new GrumpyCatWidget().render($('body'));
    });

As you notice I was forced to remove the es6 import syntax when importing GrumpyCatWidget.js, that is needed because es6 imports are designed to be statically resolved so they should be at the top of the file and outside any code branch.

If you run again

    npm run build

you should now find a 1.bundle.js file under your builds folder, and if you surround your require.ensure statement with some logic this 1.bundle.js will be loaded on demand only if this logic is satisfied.

### What's next?

This was just a simple introduction of the basic concepts behind webpack, you can add plenty of features as hot-reload, minification, jslint etc.
